'Hello to Jenkins from Montana! This mountain cat has a few simple pleasures in life - one of them is hunting. “Although I use my claws, paws and teeth to hunt and kill my prey, I understand when some human hunters get defensive about wanting to keep their guns. My sympathy stops with people that say that bump stocks or large assault weapons are on the same playing field as standard rifles. Can you say FAKE MEWS? Some weapons are designed to kill large amounts of people at once, and that’s not cool. Ameowrica shouldn’t be a combat zone!” Gun control and mental health should be at the top of our priority list, little Jenks!
