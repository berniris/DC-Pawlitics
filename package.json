Masha collects and posts pictures of cats we know and creates political blurbs in the voice of the cat. Each post is filled with tons of puns and we want [DC Fake Mews](https://www.instagram.com/dcfakemews/) to go viral so I am creating a web app version to increase exposure and get non Instagram folks following.",
