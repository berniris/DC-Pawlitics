# User Story 
I am creating an app based off my friend Masha's Instagram account, DC Fake Mews. Masha collects and posts pictures of cats in our lives and cats all over DC and creates political blurbs in the voice of the cat. Each post is filled with tons of puns and we want DC Fake Mews to go viral so I am creating a web app version to increase exposure and get non Instagram folks following. 

## Here's how the flow of the app will work:

The user first arrives at a landing page containing login/sign-up links at the top, DC Pawlitics title in the middle and DC Fake Mews as the subtitle. Underneath I'll have three links for them to navigate to the CRUD peices. 
   1. Meet the Cats - this link will take you to a page which will display or "get all" the cats, their pictures and incude a short bio. 
   2. Kitty Op-Eds - this page will contain the picture of the cat side by side with their opinion blurb and the hashtags to describe their post eg. #catslivesmatter
   3. Submit Your Feline - links to a form to submit your cat's name, photo, and age and the part of DC they live and any other facts we should know about their current frustrations with our political system. Masha will be able to use this data to create future posts and feature more cats than ever! 

The login/sign up links at the top will probably be post MVP. Ideally, I would like the user to be able to register for an account which will assign them a portal where they can add and delete favorite cats. The registration form will require them to select a username and password for return visits.

# Potential Challenges/Roadblocks

# 1. Time mangement!
I plan to set benchmarks for myself (see Time estimates below) and also follow the practice of starting small, testing it out to see if it works, and then moving on to the next peice. I think this will help me alot with time management because it will decrease my debugging time if I can isolate issues quickly. 

# 2. Incorporating delete part of CRUD. 
Ideally I don't want the user to have the ability to delete cat posts so I need to have a way for them to have an account to save favorite cats which can be deleted after. This gets into authentication which is something I wanted to focus on post-MVP but 'delete' is a hard requirement for the project. Might just have to allow the user to actually delete from the database :/

## Time estimates
# End of Day:
 Thursday - Completed pseudo code of all pages, Obtain all pictures for app. Create schema for database. Server config and     basic setup done.
 Friday - Complete creation of model.
 Saturday - Complete views and controller. 
 Sunday - Complete all 'ejs' files and begin styling. 
 Monday - Work on finishing touches. Push completed MVP. Create a new branch to implement post MVP features if there is still time.
